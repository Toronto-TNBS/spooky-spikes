            This section will introduce various preparatory steps available on the “Main” tab and left panel, which
            are to be taken before all signal features can be computed and displayed. These include filtering, peak

            <p class="pp-text">
                By default, the filtering feature is disabled. To enable it, select the “Filtering” checkbox on the
                left panel in the “Parameters” section (<a class="repo-link" href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>). This will
                allow the user to enter high-pass and low-pass frequency cutoffs for a fourth-order Butterworth filter
                that is applied to the imported signal. To utilize the frequency cutoffs for the filter, enter them
                into the corresponding widgets and press the “Set” button on the “Main” tab within the “Signal
                filtering” section. The signal will be updated on the main plot immediately upon setting cutoff
                frequencies. Please see <a class="repo-link" href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a> for an example of setting
                frequency cutoffs in the correct dashboard sections.
            </p>
            <p class="pp-text">
                If the user enters both high-pass and low-pass cutoffs, a bandpass filter design is applied. If only
                one of either a high-pass or low-pass cutoff is set, then a high-pass or low-pass filter design is
                applied, respectively. To disapply filtering and retain the raw data, users can either uncheck the
                “Filtering” checkbox, or clear the frequency cutoff entries, and press the “Set” button alongside empty
                widget boxes.

                In order for various spike-dependent features to be computed, a threshold-crossing method is first
                applied to detect peaks of action potentials within the electrophysiological data. Within the
                “Threshold” section of the “Main” tab, the user can enter a scaling factor that is applied to the
                median absolute deviation (MAD) of the data. Press “Set” within the same section to apply the factor
                and calculate the threshold (<a class="repo-link" href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a>). Spike peaks will be
                computed immediately and will be available for visualization. If no threshold is set, features
                requiring a spike-train will not be computed and displayed on the “Features” tab.
            </p>
            <p class="pp-text">
                It must also be noted that setting a threshold to detect spiking is a necessary prerequisite for
                analysis methods such as spike sorting (see Section 2.3).

                For some electrophysiological data, depending on the system one uses, spiking can occur in either the
                anodic (upward—positive) or cathodic (downward—negative) direction. Users can adjust the threshold
                detection direction such that it matches their data. By default, the threshold and detection of peaks
                is applied in the cathodic direction. However, click the “Invert Threshold” checkbox on the left panel
                in the “Parameters” section to apply this feature in the anodic direction.

                On the “Main” tab, the signal the user has selected will appear in time-series format on the graph.
                The “Plot Display” section of the “Main” tab includes three checkboxes, all of which provide additional
                flexibility for visualizing spiking within the signal. The “Spike Train” checkbox will show the
                locations of the spikes as an event-plot above the main signal. “Event Peaks” will display the spike
                peaks overlayed on top of the main signal within the main plot. Finally, “Threshold Bar” will present
                a fixed dotted line at the amplitude corresponding to the threshold for peak detection. It must be
                noted that all three of the available display features enumerated in this paragraph only become
                available after a threshold has been set, since a threshold is the necessary condition for peak
                detection. Additionally, users can zoom in and out, move the signal, and save the figure using the
                toolbar at the bottom of the tab, directly below the plot. Please see
                <a class="repo-link" href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a> for an example of the utilization of all three

        <p class="pp-text">
            Spooky Spikes includes spike sorting capabilities. Users can select between various clusters of noise and
            spikes to isolate the activity of interest and refine their analyses. This spike sorting method consists of
            a principal component analysis followed by k-Means clustering. The first two principal components are
            displayed on the “Spike Sorting” tab. Additionally, users may refine their spike sorting results by
            manually selecting the fixed number of clusters used to fit the data on the same tab under the “Number of
            Clusters” heading (<a class="repo-link" href="#figure-3">Figure 3</a>). Otherwise, the number of clusters is automatically determined based on
            optimal clustering performance using a silhouette score as a quality metric. The silhouette score for the
            selected cluster is displayed on the “Features” tab.

        </figure>
        <p class="pp-text">
            Following spike sorting, features are re-calculated based on the selected cluster. The selected cluster is
            then displayed on the dropdown menu in the “Select Cluster” section of the “Main” tab. By default, the
            cluster with spike peaks possessing the highest average amplitude is selected. Within the same tab, the
            spike waveforms corresponding to the selected cluster are displayed on the main plot as distinctly coloured
            compared to the rest of the signal (<a class="repo-link" href="#figure-4">Figure 4</a>). As users select different clusters, signal features are
            re-calculated according to the cluster that has been chosen. This processing method offers an efficient
            means of isolating different activity and dynamically computing signal characteristics.

            Following the fulfillment of the necessary preparatory requirements, features are calculated dynamically
            and presented in the form of numerical displays as well as figures. Additionally, as previously noted in
            various places, features are dynamically calculated depending on the method used for detecting spike peaks.
            As users switch between methods (threshold-crossing versus spike sorting), or even alter clustering
            parameters (number of clusters and selected cluster), the features will be re-computed accordingly. This
            must be considered, since small alterations in user-selected parameters can drastically change the results

                field potential (LFP) power (<a class="repo-link" href="#figure-5">Figure 5</a>). It must be noted that if a simple threshold-crossing method is
                used to calculate spikes and thus, features, then the silhouette score will not be available, since
                this is a quality metric pertaining to the clustering algorithm used in spike sorting. Furthermore,
                all characteristics within the LFP category do not require the detection of spiking peaks to be

                frequency bands with highlighted bursting regions (<a class="repo-link" href="#figure-6">Figure 6C</a>). Finally, "Autocorrelation Plot"
                reveals the signal's autocorrelation up to a 0.5-second lag. Additionally, the power spectrum at four
                different frequency bands is displayed (<a class="repo-link" href="#figure-6">Figure 6D</a>).

            Spooky Spikes allows users to save the results of their analysis. All save options can be found on the main
            left panel of the application under the “Export” heading (<a class="repo-link" href="#figure-7">Figure 7</a>). First, users can save the numerical
            features extracted from the electrophysiological signal to a spreadsheet. Each feature corresponds to a
            distinct column while the first row is populated by the resultant features. Furthermore, the signal segment
            can be saved along with the timestamps of individual spikes found either by threshold-crossing or spike
            sorting. The “Save Segment (All Spikes)” option will save the imported signal and all spiking timestamps
            as events in separate channels, or columns depending on the filetype used at the save. Additionally, “Save
            Segment (Selected Cluster)” will save the imported signal and only the timestamps of spikes belonging to
            the selected cluster following spike sorting.
